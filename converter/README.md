# Converter

Another tiny project for learning EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) as well as trying to replace NetBeans with IntelliJ IDEA. It is a simple currency converter which can convert USD into JPY and EUR. Worked with IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.0 and a snapshot version of GlassFish 4.2.0.

The code was taken from the examples of Java EE from Oracle. See the content of each file for the detailed license.
