# WAM Calculator

This is the first project my teammates and I wrote while taking the Java EE course. It's a calculator for WAM (Weighted Average Mark), which can take up to 5 courses into calculation (because we didn't know how to use arrays in JSF data binding).

The project was created using NetBeans 8.0.2 with GlassFish 4.1, JSF and of course, Java EE. The web pages were written with Google's Material Design Lite framework and some bootstrap CSS & JavaScript code.

Java sucks.
